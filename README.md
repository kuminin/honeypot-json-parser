# honeypot-json-parser

#####Given a honeypot.json file, the program will ask the user for the port or ip to search. Then the user will input a list of ip or port, depending on the previous input. Then the program will load the json file and print victimIP, attackerIP, connectionType, victimPort, attackerPort, and the date for the given user input list. If the user's initial input does not equal port or ip, the program will not run.
